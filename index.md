I graduated with a degree in [Chemical Engineering](http://chbe.ubc.ca) from UBC Vancouver ([BASc '18](https://www.ubc.ca/)).Iâ€™m currently a Business Process Consultant in Toronto's [Financial District.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_District,_Toronto). My hobbies include writing [good (-ish) code](https://github.com/lowiejiang) and drinking excessive volumes of caffeine. I also enjoy napping, sleeping in, discovering new electronic music, and binge-watching Netflix on a regular basis. My more productive hobbies include reading culture articles, weighted jump rope skipping, hiking (sometimes), and skiing (always).

In my past life, I worked on energy engineering projects at [Suncor Energy](https://www.suncor.com/en-ca) and [Broadsword Corrosion](https://www.broadswordcorrosion.com/).

I like working on technical puzzles. I am most interested in challenges that lie at the intersection of business and technology.
